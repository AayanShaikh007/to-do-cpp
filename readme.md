# To-do Task manager
This is a to-do list productivity app where you can make to-do items, give them a description (something i cant do on my to-do app on my phone), and optionally set a time when you want the task to be finished by. At the time when the task is supposed to be over, an beep will play to alert you that you should be done "x" task by now. This is intended to be used as a to-do list that you can use to organize small specific tasks you need to accompolish during a single work session. 

For this project, I decided to make something with a language I had never used for a project before. I chose C++ because it was a language that I've always wanted to learn/make stuff with, and I never really got the chance to use it before. 

I started off learning c++ syntax and usage using some tutorials from youtube.   

I will be making a to do list manager, because I wouldnt need to spend too long figuring out features to make because I recently made an API with a similar theme (different language obviously ).  

I will start off with a terminal based app with the following functionalities. 

- Create To-do items / add items to the To-do list.
- Remove/rename items
- Add optional description to items
- Add due date to item (optional)
- Alarms when the due date approaches/passes.  (Note: Beep functionlity is only available on windows systems)

Terminal Actions:
1. Show all to-do items
3. Add an item
2. Modify/remove an item

After addings some initial functionality, i pushed the changes to github.
