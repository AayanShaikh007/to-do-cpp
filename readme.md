# To-do Task manager
This is intended to be used as a to-do list that you can use to organize small specific tasks you need to accompolish during a single work session. 

For this project, I decided to make something with a language I had never used for a project before. I chose C++ because it was a language that I've always wanted to learn/make stuff with, and I never really got the chance to use it before. 

I started off learning c++ syntax and usage using some tutorials from youtube.   

I will be making a to do list manager, because I wouldnt need to spend too long figuring out features to make because I recently made an API with a similar theme (different language obviously ).  

I will start off with a terminal based app with the following functionalities. 

- Create To-do items / add items to the To-do list.
- Remove/rename items
- Add optional description to items
- Add due date to item (optional)
- Alarms when the due date approaches/passes.  (Note: Beep functionlity is only available on windows systems)

Terminal Actions:
1. Show all to-do items
3. Add an item
2. Modify/remove an item

After addings some initial functionality, i pushed the changes to github.
